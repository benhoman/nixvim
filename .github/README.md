# Nixvim Configuration

## Configuring

To start configuring, just add or modify the nix files in `./config`.
If you add a new configuration file, remember to add it to the
[`config/default.nix`](./config/default.nix) file

## Testing your new configuration

To test your configuration simply run the following command

```
nix run .
```

If you have nix intalled, you can directly run my config from anyhwere

You can try running mine with:

```shell
nix run 'github:benhoman/nixvim'
```

## Installing into NixOS configuration

This `nixvim` flake will output a derivation that you can easily include
in either `home.packages` for `home-manager`, or
`environment.systemPackages` for `NixOS`. Or whatever happens with darwin?

You can add my `nixvim` configuration as an input to your `NixOS` configuration like:

```nix
{
 inputs = {
    nixvim.url = "github:benhoman/nixvim";
 };
}
```

### Direct installation

With the input added you can reference it directly.

```nix
{ inputs, system, ... }:
{
  # NixOS
  environment.systemPackages = [ inputs.nixvim.packages.${system}.default ];
  # home-manager
  home.packages = [ inputs.nixvim.packages.${system}.default ];
}
```

The binary built by `nixvim` is already named as `nvim` so you can call it just
like you normally would.

### Installing as an overlay

Another method is to overlay your custom build over `neovim` from `nixpkgs`.

This method is less straight-forward but allows you to install `neovim` like
you normally would. With this method you would just install `neovim` in your
configuration (`home.packges = with pkgs; [ neovim ]`), but you replace
`neovim` in `pkgs` with your derivation from `nixvim`.

```nix
{
  pkgs = import inputs.nixpkgs {
    inherit system;
    overlays = [
      (final: prev: {
        neovim = inputs.nixvim.packages.${system}.default;
      })
    ];
  }
}
```
